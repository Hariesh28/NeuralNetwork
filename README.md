Overview
--------

This project provides a foundational implementation of a neural network built entirely in Python from the ground up. It is designed for educational purposes as well as for those looking to explore and understand the basics of neural network operations without relying on high-level frameworks. Whether you are a student, researcher, or an enthusiastic developer, this project will help you gain insights into:

*   How neural networks learn and generalize.
    
*   The structure of layers, weights, biases, and activation functions.
    
*   The process of forward propagation, backpropagation, and optimization.
    

Features
--------

*   **Custom Implementation:** Build and train neural networks without relying on external deep learning libraries.
    
*   **Modular Design:** Easily extend the network architecture to add new layers, activation functions, or loss functions.
    
*   **Hands-on Examples:** Includes practical demonstrations on classification and regression tasks.
    
*   **Educational Resource:** Serves as a reference implementation for understanding the core principles of neural networks.

*   **Regression:** Learn how to implement and tune regression models using a neural network. Example scripts illustrate parameter optimization and performance assessment.
    

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

*   **Python 3.6 or later:** The code is written in Python and requires a compatible version.
    
*   **Jupyter Notebook (optional):** For interactive exploration of examples in the Classification and Regression directories.
    
*   **Basic knowledge of Python:** Familiarity with Python programming and elementary machine learning concepts will be helpful.
    

### Installation

1.  git clone https://github.com/Hariesh28/NeuralNetwork.gitcd NeuralNetwork
    
2.  python -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activate # On Windows use: venv\\Scripts\\activate
    
3.  This project leverages standard Python libraries (e.g., numpy, matplotlib). Install these via pip:pip install numpy matplotlib
    

Usage
-----

### Training a Model

The core of the project is designed to allow you to quickly configure and train a neural network on your own data. A typical training workflow includes:

1.  **Data Preparation:** Load your dataset and preprocess it to match the input requirements of the network.
    
2.  **Model Configuration:** Define the architecture (number of layers, activation functions, etc.) in the main Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks.
    
3.  **Training Loop:** Use the provided training loop to perform forward propagation, compute the loss, backpropagate errors, and update weights.
    
4.  **Evaluation:** Validate the model performance on test data and visualize the results using provided plotting utilities.
    

### Example Scripts

*   **Classification Example:** Run the notebook/script in the Classification folder to see how the neural network distinguishes between classes.
    
*   **Regression Example:** Open the notebook/script in the Regression folder to observe how the network approximates continuous functions.
    

To run an example, simply open the corresponding Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Classification/test_classification.ipynb 
```

Or execute a Python script:
```bash
python Classification/NN_Classification.py
```

Customization and Extensibility
-------------------------------

The project is built with modularity in mind:

*   **Adding Layers:** Create new layer types by extending the base layer class.
    
*   **Activation Functions:** Experiment with different activation functions by modifying or adding new functions.
    
*   **Loss Functions:** Integrate custom loss functions to suit your specific needs.
    
*   **Optimization:** Adjust or replace the current gradient descent implementation with more sophisticated optimization algorithms.
    

By modifying the source code, you can tailor the neural network to fit various applications and experiment with advanced deep learning techniques.

Future Enhancements
-------------------

Planned improvements and features include:

*   **Advanced Architectures:** Support for deeper architectures and convolutional layers.
    
*   **Extended Examples:** Additional demos covering topics like dropout, regularization, and batch normalization.
    
*   **Performance Optimizations:** Implementing vectorized operations and exploring GPU acceleration.
    
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** Enhance data visualization to better illustrate the training process and performance metrics.
